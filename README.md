basic TODO application inspired by "Time Management for Sysadmins."

the Perl version is the new, shiny version. the shell script version
is included for historical completion.

**Usage**
1) drop the script somewhere. I `git clone` the whole repo into ~/code.

2) symlink (or copy) somewhere in your $PATH  "todo.pl" to "todo" and "newday".
the script behaves differently if you run it with a different name. (this behavior may be changed/supplemented later)

3) start using your new TODO system!
